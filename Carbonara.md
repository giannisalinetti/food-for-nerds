# Carbonara Recipe: the path to awesomeness

This is the best recipe you can find in this Universe to cook a delicious
carbonara. Indeed it is not a recipe, it is a guide to awesomeness.

## Ingredients
First rule: grep raw materials make great dishes. This is especially true for
this minimal recipe where the super quality of ingredients is the key.

For 2 people you need:

- 300 gr of spaghetti or rigatoni (I like it abundant). 
  Best labels are: De Cecco, Garofalo, Del Verde, Rummo. Stay away from Barilla.
  My favorite is one is Rummo:

- 3 very fresh eggs. Best if organic. I use one egg for every 100gr of past.
  Some people use the whole eggs, and I did it for a while. Lately I prefer to 
  use only the yolk with an extra egg white part. A nice mix is the yolk of 
  2 eggs and a third whole egg.
- a good Pecorino cheese. Here are some links to buy it online:

- Guanciale (pork cheek).

- Salt and pepper. Better if you have raw pepper to freshly shred, it will
  preserve more taste.

As you can see there are absolutely no cream and no bacon.

## Preliminary tasks

### Boil the water!
Fill a pot with water and add a good pinch of cooking salt and start boiling it.

### Guanciale 
Start slicing the guanciale: cut slices from the shortes side. Remove the rind
before.
When you have 3/4 slices start making little pieces from them. The size is
important: they should not be too big nor too small. 40mm x 7mm x 7mm is 
a nice approximation.

Put the pieces in the a preheated pan: we want it to cook very slowly with absolutely
**NO OIL**. Set a very moderate flame/temperature to avoid overburning it.
It will mold slowly and release its own grease. Its beatiful smell will make you 
cry for the happiness!

### Pecorino
Start shredding the pecorino in a bowl. I don't give you an exact weight 
since it's a matter of taste. I like it abundant... :) 

### Eggs
Open the eggs in another bowl and shake them slowly and sweetly, you don't want 
to incorporate too much air. Start adding the pepper and the shredded pecorino 
to the egg and keep blending, until you have a creamy mix (not too much dense yet).

## Core tasks
Check the guanciale, it should become a little crispy but not too much and it 
should have released a lot of grease. Don't overcook or it will become too dry and
thin loosing the right consistence.
When it's done take away 2/3 of the guanciale slices from the pan. Put some of 
them (4/5 pieces are enough) and a little spool of its grease in the egg and 
incorporate. This will help to not cook the egg to much later. 

When the water boils (not before) add the pasta and cook it for the right time 
(the brands I suggested usually need 11-13 minutes). Cook it for two minutes less 
than the suggested time: during the mixing process in the pan the pasta will keep 
on cooking. Don't use a strainer since you want to keep some cooking water 
incorporated, it will help you to obtain something more creamy.

### Creaming time
Jump the pasta and the guanciale together for a minute. Add a first, lovely pinch
of shredded pecorino cheese and some more peper (carbonara without pepper is like
drinking alcohol free beer). Mix with care and energy at the same time. 
Also remember to save an extra glass of cooking water for later use.

Now the hard part where true heroes rise: put the eggs on the pasta and start 
mixing. The rule of thumb is simple: we absolutely don't want an omelette.
My advice is to keep the pan away from the flame since an excessive amount of heat 
will cook the egg too fast with a omelette-like result. Keep on mixing, moving 
back and forth the pan on the fire if the temperature lowers too much. Add some 
other shredded pecorino and pepper, the real taste of the carbonara is very strong 
with a lot of pepper. If it becomes too tight add a small amount of cooking water 
and keep on mixing.

When you get a creamy result you are ready to serve. The level of egg cooking is 
something very personal: some people prefer it very rare, some other well done.

Add a small amount of pecorino on the dish and pepper to decorare. 

Your carbonara is ready. Taste galore!
